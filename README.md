Code declaration:

This experiment design and code work are completed by the author's team. In addition to some basic algorithm modules, open source codes on the Internet are used for reference, such as the calculation idea of OMP algorithm, the solution of BPDN, K-SVD algorithm, the generation of multiple observation matrices, etc. This experiment is to study, apply and expand the existing achievements.

The code package can run in the windows environment with MATLAB.
